# Fibonacci Clock
Its a clock widget inspired from the fibonacci sequence.
## Description and Usage
### What is a fibonacci sequence
The fibonacci sequence is a sequence of numbers created by the italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 13th century. This is a sequence starting with 1 and 1 , where each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.
### Fibonacci and Clock
For the clock I have used the first five number of Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3 and 5. UI of the clock is made up of five squares whose side lengths match these numbers in ratio. Hours are displayed by red, minutes using blue, and if the box is used to display both hours as well as minutes it is colored green, finally unused square is left white.
### How do I tell time
To tell time on the fibonacci clock you need to do some math. To read the hour, simply add up the corresponding values of the red and green squares. To read the minutes, do the same with the green and blue squares. The minutes are displayed in 5 minutes increment (0 to 12) so you have to multiply your result by 5 to get actual number .
### Fun Part
Often, there are multiple ways to display a single time. To add, the combinations are picked randomly from all different ways a number can be displayed. 
#### There are, for example, 16 different ways to display 6:30 and you never know which one the clock will use :)
### Tech Info
- It is updated every 3 minutes.
- U can instantly update it by a single click. (Try this to see different combinations for a specific time **B-)** ).
